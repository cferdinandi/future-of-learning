                <h2>Is the corporate university dead?</h2>
                <p><em>Excerpted from Forbes' <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/karlmoore/2011/09/07/is-the-corporate-university-dead/">"Is the Traditional Corporate University Dead?"</a></em></p>

                <p>Are traditional Corporate Universities dying off? Through some work I have been doing with Henry Mintzberg and Phil LeNir, I recently became aware of a fascinating corporate training program at ING Bank in Amsterdam.  ING is a global financial institution of Dutch origin, offering banking, investments, life insurance, and retirement services to 85 million customers in 40 countries. I have taught some of ING  employees  on the MBA at the Rotterdam School of Management – always impressive people.</p>

                <p>The story concerns two of ING’s learning professionals, Mireille Jansma and Jurgen Egges, who oversee “innovative learning.” (Their job title alone piqued my interest.) In an effort to make corporate learning more responsive to rapidly changing trends and to expand its reach into ING’s total workforce, Jansma and Egges devised a strategy that they called “Connect, Connect, Connect.” Abbreviated Connect3, the name reflects their philosophy that the most effective corporate learning derives from connecting (1) people with information, (2) people with people, and (3) communities with communities.</p>

                <p>The Connect3 strategy consists of a sort of 1-2-3 punch of coordinated “learning events” all focused on expanding the corporate learning platform.</p>

                <p>First, Jansma and Egges gather articles and reports about relevant trends in management, banking, and finance. Next, they broadcast out what they call “Research Alerts” – a summary and links to the articles – using the social bookmarking site Diigo and via an email blast to any ING employee who signed up for the alerts.</p>

                <p>Periodically, when an important Research Alert deserves serious attention, they host a “Knowledge Café” – an open meeting where the topic is thrown open for debate and discussion. Some cafés are open to specific groups of managers but others are available to anyone in the company at any level. Jansma and Egges produce a video to explore the topic before the Café is held, and managers can follow up on the same topic via small discussion groups and relevant materials from a firm called CoachingOurselves, run by by Phil and grounded in the work of of my colleague Henry Mintzberg.</p>
