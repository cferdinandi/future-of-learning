                <h2>Where does online learning fall short?</h2>
                <p><em>Excerpted from <a href="http://www.strangenative.com/toward-a-new-education/">"Towards a New Education."</a></em></p>
                
                <p>In order to begin solving for this new kind of education we first need a system that can amass, maintain, and deliver an incredible amount of knowledge content, while being freely accessible. There’s a model that exists for such a system: Wikipedia.</p>

                <p>I should cite the web in general here, but Wikipedia is much better for this discussion because it has a much higher signal to noise ratio than the rest of the web. I truly believe the web at large is and will be the true knowledge commons which we draw upon to educate our population.</p>

                <p>While it has been derided in the past for playing host to a number of content controversies, on the whole this knowledge commons has proved to be an incredibly useful and accurate resource for sharing and spreading information. You can find everything from an in-depth history of the Battle of Bunker Hill to a list of corporations currently in support of SOPA.</p>

                <p>Wikipedia generates content with greater speed, higher accuracy, and lower cost than any publisher in history.</p>

                <p>It’s a guess, but a confident one. It is a central vessel through which collective knowledge is curated and disseminated. It’s organized and throughly linked, creating a frictionless flow between content and content sources. I can’t count the number of times I’ve gone to Wikipedia to get a quick answer and found myself falling deeper and deeper down a rabbit hole of links to other interesting articles. It is a system optimized for following what interests you.</p>

                <p>But something is missing: a higher level context. How might a student string the best content from the web and Wikipedia together to gain a real education in algebra, World War II, french literature, or programming computer vision algorithms? How do we turn the knowledge commons into coursework?</p>

                <h3>A Coursework of the Commons</h3>

                <p>To provide context, we need a platform that allows anyone to collect and categorize content. Plenty of web collection platforms already exist: Delicious, Pinterest, Gimme Bar, Svpply and Evernote are just a few examples off the top of my head. However, this platform would encourage collections that educate and inspire rather than entertain or impress.</p>

                <p>To make an attempt at educating, it would need some distinct features. The sequencing of the content within each collection would be vital. With which piece of content should I start? With which should I end? Which content pieces are crucial and which are added insight? Assessment and achievement frameworks would be needed with each collection. Members should be able to construct and curate supersets around major subjects like biology by bringing together collections on topics like cell-division and scientific naming schemes. For a student, working through a superset might equate to finishing a year of school in the subject.</p>

                <p><a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>, <a href="http://www.guaranteach.com/">Sophia Pathways</a>, and <a href="http://www.knewton.com/partners/">Knewton</a> are all attacking the curriculum problem in one form or another, but most are generating both the content and the content connections internally. It’s a good place to start as the value of online learning platforms is still being proven, but they’re resigning themselves to outmoded teaching and publishing models. They’re missing the real opportunity.</p>

                <p>The most efficient way to source and maintain a coursework is by following Wikipedia’s model. Provide the right incentives and compulsion loops to drive creation as well as checks and balances to maintain quality content and you accomplish the end result at a fraction of the cost and in a fraction of the time. Just as Wikipedia has amassed and maintained knowledge of the commons, so too can this platform amass and maintain a coursework of the commons.</p>

                <h3>The Personal Lens</h3>

                <blockquote>“The rise of online learning carries with it an unprecedented opportunity to transform the schooling system into a student-centric one that can affordably customize for different student needs by allowing all students to learn at their appropriate pace and path, thereby allowing each student to realize his or her fullest potential...”</blockquote>

                <p>We’re getting smarter about data; both how we collect it and how it influences our experiences. The only way for a personalized system to scale is through intelligent use of data. It starts with a student profile that assesses what kind of learner I am. This profile would gauge what my strengths, interests and challenges are.</p>

                <p>Once that’s established in an uniform way, my experience can be connected to the experiences of others like me, all around the world. Content can be recommended to me based on the success of others who share my profile. In turn, the content and connections I find success in can be recommended to others with similar profiles or interests. The success of one can lead to the success of many.</p>

                <p>By building the platform around the student you can recommend learning pathways instead of dictating curriculum. It amounts to a zero-friction mechanism for students to study what they find valuable and build on their inherent strengths. It also enables some incredible new possibilities. An impoverished student, for zero cost, could follow the education of a wealthy student blessed with the world’s best tutors. An avid science student could follow in the educational footsteps of his favorite astronaut or nobel laureate.</p>

                <p>Tying personal goals together with successful pathways to achieving those goals creates an ecosystem where students feel like they’re working toward something, not just taking exams in a scholastic vacuum. Learning becomes applicable. Visualizing the educational process provides additional motivation. By depicting the milestones passed and milestones ahead, you give students a sense of building accomplishments every step of the way. Such a system begins to tie into the powerful game mechanics that have made games like World of Warcraft so engrossing. Though earning ‘experience points’ alone doesn’t amount to a full game mechanic, it is one essential piece of the compulsion-loop puzzle.</p>

                <p>Visualizing the totality of a student’s education gives them, their parents, their future employer and their nation a truer portrait of their skills. It shows their passions, their strengths and their weaknesses. Having such a wealth of data to visualize would help us move away from using diplomas as a stand-in for an education toward visualizing the shape and character of the education itself.</p>

                <h3>The Distributed Classroom</h3>

                <p>But weren’t we talking about the proliferation of inexpensive, connected, handheld devices? Yes, we were. Let’s get back to that.</p>

                <p>With a personalized coursework of the commons available any time and any place, directed content and assessment can be provided outside the classroom setting. Students will be able to learn from anywhere: from the home, a public library, a place of business or from a public or private educational institution. Anywhere a sufficient wireless signal can be found, a personalized and contextual learning experience can be delivered. Awesome.</p>

                <p>We’re nearly there, but as Devin Coldewey pointed out in his recent Techcrunch article: “Students must learn, true, but they must also be taught.”4 So what effect will all this have on the role of the teacher? One of the bigger challenges facing our educational system is a lack of human resources. There just aren’t enough great teachers to go around. There are a few brilliant individuals who manage to put up with the less than stellar paycheck and working conditions. But even when they do our current system tragically limits their reach: thirty students per period, six to eight periods a day. That’s two hundred and forty students a year if they’re running themselves ragged. Finding a way to scale the reach of our teachers is a daunting hurdle.</p>

                <p>It is exactly the proliferation of inexpensive, powerful, connected devices that will finally change that. These devices will enable teachers to hold court in thousands of locations around the world, simultaneously. Apple’s iTunes U, a source of free, pre-recorded college lectures from some of the most esteemed universities in the world, has had incredible success on mobile devices:</p>

                <blockquote>“It seems that mobile devices have had a huge part to play in the surge in popularity of iTunes U, doubling its number of downloads in the past year… recent figures show that almost a fifth of the Open University’s iTunes U visits arrive via an iPad.”</blockquote>

                <p>In the hands of students, these portable, robust devices will allow teachers to live-stream their lectures anywhere in the world while receiving real-time questions and feedback from students listening in. Does that seem overwhelming? Well, imagine the time a teacher would save if he/she didn’t have to deliver the same lecture to six to eight classes a day. If the lecture were only delivered once, the teacher could instead focus on fielding student questions and providing one-on-one attention where needed. “When a teacher doesn’t have to be consumed with delivering content they can become a coach and a tutor to the students and help them on an individual basis.”</p>

                <p>Courtney Cadwell, a teacher in the Los Altos School District uses a “blended” teaching approach, combining Khan Academy’s brilliantly composed online lectures with various in-person instruction and tutoring:</p>

                <blockquote>“When the Khan Academy aligns well with our 7th grade pre-algebra curriculum, I find myself using the Flex Model by allowing Sal Khan to deliver the direct instruction via his online videos as I provide support by way of one-on-one tutoring and flexible grouping based on student needs.”</blockquote>

                <p>Such a system relieves the redundancies necessary in a closed classroom model without making teachers redundant. Talent can finally begin to scale. In such an environment, the role of the teacher will shift from recitation to inspiration. As Dr. Christensen puts it: “…Rather than everybody having to put up with crummy teachers, everyone can learn from the best.”</p>

                <p>A system like this benefits our best teachers because it’s a system that desires content shapers and connectors, not just content delivery drones. In such a system, tenure isn’t a privilege bestowed through bureaucracy, it is a long-lasting relevancy earned through incredible dedication to shaping and delivering knowledge.</p>
